# Reference For Advance Physics Course in Information Technology

This Repository is documentation of my class, please do not confuse me as a teacher.

## Information

> **How does teaching work?**

The course is taught in hybrid model which mean, there are contact lessons (on university premesis) and remote lesson(for e.g. with Zoom).

- Weekly video lectures will be available once a week on online platfrom, at latest on friday each week.
- There is weekly exercise classes where we work on exercises based on lectures.
- Weekly quiz or a small exercise task each week.

You must watch the video lecture and attend the exercise class before attempting the quizzes!

## Week 1: Introduction and Overview of Course

### task related to week1.

> - Install Python and Jupyter notebook or log in to Google Cloud.
> - Setup VScode, juptry Notebook, python and dependent library.
> - Write your first Jupyter notebook, Hello World or something else.
> - Return the pdf of the screenshot which shows a successful running of the code.

## Week 2: Reading Data using pandas and ploting graph using matplotlib

### Task for week 2

> - Carry out about 30s observation of acceleration using Phyphox and save the data to your computer.
> - Write a Jupyter notebook where you first read the data using Pandas.
> - Then make a graph of all three components (x,y,z) of acceleration using matplotlib.pyplot.
> - You can plot each of them to a separate panel or in the same panel using different panels and a legend to distinguish between components.
> - Name the axis, set reasonable axis limits and set gridlines.
> - Return a pdf file which contains your figure and a short description of the motion of the mobile phone during the observations based on the graph.python_fundamentals.ipynb

### Learning outcome

> Basic data Types in Python

- Basics includes Int, Str, Bool, Float, Complex
- Casting to int, to Str
- Operator in Python
- List in python, accessing by index, instering in list
- class and object in python, its methods and attributes, self parameter

> dataPy_notebook.ipynb

- using libraries like numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- basic Mathematical operation like mean, median, sd, variance using
  numpy
- Read data using Pandas
- data Visualization using Mathplotlib

> RawDAta.csv

- is a csv(comma Seprated file) that is genertated using acclerometer
  without g in PHYPHOX(a mobile a collecting data)
